        <h1 id="New-England-Patriots-Are-in-the-Gaming-Industry-in-41-States"><a href="#New-England-Patriots-Are-in-the-Gaming-Industry-in-41-States" class="headerlink" title="New England Patriots Are in the Gaming Industry in 41 States"></a>New England Patriots Are in the Gaming Industry in 41 States</h1><p>The Patriots organization is getting into the gaming industry, a move that will put it in 41 states.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the NFL team has partnered with DraftKings, a daily fantasy sports site, in what is said to be a five-year deal.</p>
<p>This will make the Patriots the first team in the NFL to have an ownership stake in a gaming company.</p>
<p>“We view this as an opportunity to build on our fan engagement initiatives and further diversify our brand,” said Meredith McPhee, the Patriots’ Executive Vice President for Public and Community Affairs.</p>
<p>She added that the move also highlights how NFL teams are “businesses first and foremost.”</p>
<p>The Patriots aren’t the only team looking to expand their brand into new industries. The Steelers have partnered with Pittsburgh-based online casino Rivers Casino while the Cowboys teamed up with WinStar World Casino and Resort.</p>
<h1 id="New-England-Patriots-Are-the-Largest-Pro-Gaming-Franchise-in-the-United-States"><a href="#New-England-Patriots-Are-the-Largest-Pro-Gaming-Franchise-in-the-United-States" class="headerlink" title="New England Patriots Are the Largest Pro Gaming Franchise in the United States"></a>New England Patriots Are the Largest Pro Gaming Franchise in the United States</h1><p>The New England Patriots are not only one of the most successful NFL franchises of all time, they are also now the largest professional gaming franchise in the United States. The team announced a partnership with Boston-based gaming company Playspace that will make the Patriots the first major U.S. sports team to have its own dedicated e-sports training facility and team.</p>
<p>The new training facility, which is expected to open in early 2019, will be used to train professional players for international competition in games such as “League of Legends” and “Overwatch”. It will also be open to amateur players who want to improve their skills.</p>
<p>In a press release, Patriots owner Robert Kraft praised the new partnership, saying that it would help position the Patriots at the forefront of the fast-growing e-sports industry.</p>
<p>“This partnership furthers our commitment to growing our brand in new and innovative ways, while also strengthening our connection with this rapidly-growing sport and its passionate fans worldwide,” said Kraft.</p>
<p>Playspace CEO Carlos Martinez echoed Kraft’s sentiments, saying that the new facility would be a major boon for both the Patriots and Playspace.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with one of the most successful sports franchises in history and create a world-class e-sports training facility that will set a new standard for how teams across all levels can prepare for competition,” said Martinez.</p>
<p>E-sports is one of the fastest growing sectors of the sports industry, with revenues expected to top $1 billion by 2020. There are currently about 380 million people around the world who regularly watch e-sports competitions online or in person.</p>
<h1 id="New-England-Patriots-Dominate-the-US-Gaming-Industry"><a href="#New-England-Patriots-Dominate-the-US-Gaming-Industry" class="headerlink" title="New England Patriots Dominate the US Gaming Industry"></a>New England Patriots Dominate the US Gaming Industry</h1><p>The New England Patriots have continued their dominance of the US gaming industry, with a string of recent successes in both NFL and casino gaming.</p>
<p>The team’s latest triumph was winning the Super Bowl for a record-setting sixth time, further cementing their status as one of the most successful franchises in North American sport. In addition to their on-the-field exploits, the Patriots have also been enjoying success in the casino gaming world.</p>
<p>Just last year, the casino operator MGM Resorts announced that it had signed a deal with the Patriots to become their official betting partner. As part of the deal, MGM Resorts will be given exclusive access to Pats players, coaching staff and team owners for marketing purposes. The agreement is also reported to include an interactive area at Gillette Stadium that will give fans the chance to bet on games.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how the Patriots are using their brand power to expand into new areas of the gaming industry. In fact, the team has been quite active in the casino space over recent years, forming partnerships with a number of different operators. In 2017, for instance, they struck a deal with global gaming company DraftKings that made them the official daily fantasy sports partner of the Patriots.</p>
<p>This partnership gave DraftKings access to Pats players, coaches and staff for promotional purposes, as well as exclusive branding rights and other marketing initiatives. The alliance also saw DraftKings become the presenting sponsor of all New England home games.</p>
<p>So why are the Patriots so successful in the gaming world? There are likely a number of factors at play here, but at least part of it comes down to their impressive track record both on and off the field. The Patriots have built up a massive following over their long history, and this fanbase is extremely loyal. They are also one of the most successful teams in terms of wins and championships, which means that they have a lot of credibility in the eyes of fans and gamers alike.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, the Patriots organization is known for its strong branding and marketing efforts. This allows them to reach out to potential partners in the gaming world and create deals that are beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
<h1 id="New-England-Patriots-Making-Millions-from-Gaming-Industry"><a href="#New-England-Patriots-Making-Millions-from-Gaming-Industry" class="headerlink" title="New England Patriots Making Millions from Gaming Industry"></a>New England Patriots Making Millions from Gaming Industry</h1><p>The New England Patriots, one of the most successful professional sports franchises in the United States, are also one of the most profitable teams in the world. Forbes has estimated that in recent years the team has earned annual revenue totaling more than $400 million. This week the Patriots announced a new partnership with MGM Resorts International that will see the casino giant become the team’s exclusive gaming and entertainment partner.</p>
<p>Forbes says that NFL teams currently have an average value of $2.3 billion, a figure that is expected to continue to grow in coming years. The Patriots are far and away the league leaders in terms of value, with their current worth estimated at $3.7 billion. In addition to their regular income from sponsorships and broadcasting rights, NFL teams now have a new potential revenue stream from legalized gambling.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts is one of the largest casino operators in the world, with resorts located on Las Vegas Strip and in other major gambling destinations like Macau and Singapore. The company is expected to invest heavily in marketing and promotional efforts aimed at Patriots fans across New England. In return, MGM will receive exclusive rights to use team trademarks and logos for its gaming properties.</p>
<p>This partnership is only the latest indication that professional sports leagues are becoming increasingly comfortable with legalized gambling. The NFL has long been opposed to casinos and other forms of gambling, but has softened its stance in recent years as it seeks to capitalize on the growing industry. In March, the NBA announced a similar partnership with MGM Resorts that will give the casino giant exclusive rights to use league trademarks for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>While there is some concern among players and fans about how legalized gambling might impact professional sports, it’s clear that these leagues are starting to embrace it as a new source of revenue. It will be interesting to see how deals like these play out over time and what impact they have on the overall popularity of sports betting. In any case, it’s clear that the New England Patriots are cashing in on America’s love affair with gaming.</p>
<h1 id="New-England-Patriots-Leading-the-Way-in-the-US-Gaming-Industry"><a href="#New-England-Patriots-Leading-the-Way-in-the-US-Gaming-Industry" class="headerlink" title="New England Patriots Leading the Way in the US Gaming Industry"></a>New England Patriots Leading the Way in the US Gaming Industry</h1><p>New England Patriots, one of the most popular teams in American football, are now leading the way in the US gaming industry.</p>
<p>The Patriots announced a partnership with Boston-based game developer and publisher Big Huge Games on Tuesday. The new alliance will see the Patriots’ branding and logos appear in the company’s upcoming title “Crush Soda”. In return, Big Huge Games will use the team’s facilities to test its games ahead of release.</p>
<p>This is the latest move by NFL teams into the burgeoning world of gaming. The Jacksonville Jaguars struck a deal with game developer Kabam last year, while the Pittsburgh Steelers have their own arm of e-sports organisation Splyce.</p>
<p>For Big Huge Games, partnering with the Patriots is a major coup. The company is best known for developing “Rise of Nations” and “Age of Empires III”, two critically acclaimed real-time strategy games. But it has been struggling in recent years, filing for bankruptcy in 2016.</p>
<p>The Patriots hope that their association with Big Huge Games will help revive the company’s fortunes. “We are excited to work with them as they grow their business and make new games,” said team President Jonathan Kraft in a statement.</p>
<p>For gamers, this news could mean big things. With the Patriots involved, there is likely to be more focus on quality and attention to detail from Big Huge Games. This could lead to some truly innovative titles coming out of Boston in the years ahead.</p>
