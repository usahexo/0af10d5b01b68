<h1 id="What-are-the-rules-of-Booming-Gold"><a href="#What-are-the-rules-of-Booming-Gold" class="headerlink" title="What are the rules of Booming Gold?"></a>What are the rules of Booming Gold?</h1><p>In the strategy board game Booming Gold, each player starts with a set of gold pieces in their color and a number of mines, indicated by chips placed on the game board. The aim is to be the first to collect all of their gold pieces by excavating them from mines on the game board. </p>
<p>Mines can be excavated by playing cards of the same rank as the mine. Cards numbered one (1) through six (6) are each assigned a different color: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and black. When played, these cards either excavate all pieces of one color from one mine or two pieces of any other color from any mine. </p>
<p>For example, if a player has a blue three (3) and a purple five (5) in their hand, they can choose to play the blue three (3) to excavate all three blue pieces from one mine or they could play the purple five (5) to excavate two pieces of any other color from any mine. </p>
<p>If there are no cards left in a player’s hand that match the rank of a particular mine, they can forfeit their turn and draw another card. If they still have no cards that match the rank of the mines, they can either forfeit their turn or play any other card. </p>
<p>The game is won when a player either has all of their gold pieces collected or is forced to forfeit their turn due to having no playable cards left in their hand.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play Booming Gold, let’s discuss some of the strategic considerations you’ll need to keep in mind while playing. </p>
<p>Firstly, it’s important to keep track of what colors your opponent has remaining in their hand as well as which mines they still have available to them. This will help you determine which cards are most likely be played next and what order your opponent might be able to collect their gold in. </p>
<p>Secondly, you should always try and keep at least one playable card in your hand so you don’t get stuck forfeiting your turn. It’s also important to remember that certain cards can be played even if they don’t match the rank of the mine being excavated which can come in handy when trying to block your opponent from winning. </p>
<p>Lastly, it’s often helpful to try and leave at least one mine open for yourself so you can continue collecting gold pieces even if you lose access to some of your own mines.</p>
