#  Hollywood Casino Closes at Midnight Tonight

The popular Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, West Virginia will close at midnight tonight. The casino and its hotel have been a staple in the community for over a decade, but officials say that it is no longer economically feasible to keep the business open.

The casino's closure will leave over 230 employees without jobs. Many of them are hoping to find new work at the nearby Racetrack at Charles Town Races.

Charles Town Mayor John Raggio released a statement saying, "We are saddened by the closure of the Hollywood Casino, but we appreciate the contributions that it has made to our community over the years. We wish all of the employees the best of luck in their future endeavors."

The closure will also impact local businesses that have relied on Hollywood Casino customers for their patronage.

#  Blackjack Team Ends Its Run at Hollywood Casino

The blackjack team that has been playing at Hollywood Casino in St. Louis for the past few months has called it quits. The team, which is made up of four individuals, announced their decision on social media.

According to the team, they have decided to end their run at Hollywood Casino because they have “gained a lot of traction” and are now able to generate a six-figure income from blackjack.

The blackjack team first started playing at Hollywood Casino back in January. At the time, they were only earning a few hundred dollars per day. However, with the amount of success they have had in recent months, they are now able to make much more money.

While some people may be disappointed that the blackjack team is no longer playing at Hollywood Casino, others will likely be happy to know that they are no longer taking advantage of the casino’s rules.

#  Final Hours for Hollywood Casino Blackjack Team

This is it. Our final hours as a blackjack team at Hollywood Casino. We’ve been together as a team for over two years, and we’ve made a lot of money during that time. But now, our luck has run out. Management has decided to end the blackjack team and is enforcing a new policy that prohibits players from doubling down, splitting pairs, or taking insurance.

It’s going to be tough to adjust to these new rules, but we have no choice but to try. The good news is that we’ve already won a lot of money playing under the old rules, and we can leave with our heads held high. We’ll miss the camaraderie of being a team, but we’ll always remember the good times we had.

We want to thank everyone who has supported us over the last two years. We couldn’t have done it without you. And we hope that you will continue to support us as we move on to other ventures.

Good luck to all of you at Hollywood Casino – may the best player win!

#  Close of Hollywood Casino Means End of Blackjack Team

The close of Hollywood Casino in December signaled the end of professional blackjack players, who had congregated there for more than a decade.

"It's been a great run," said one player who asked not to be identified.

The team had been forced out of other casinos in the area, including Meadows Racetrack and Casino and Presque Isle Downs and Casino, in recent years.

"The cards just haven't been falling our way," the player said. "We had a good thing going at Hollywood, but it's time to move on."

Blackjack teams have been around since the early days of the game, but they've come under increasing pressure in recent years as casinos have gotten better at identifying them and restricting their play.

Casinos have also gotten better at tracking players' betting patterns and using that information to prevent them from winning too much money.

"We're always looking for unusual betting behavior," said Todd Urquhart, a spokesman for Mount Airy Casino Resort. "When we see something that doesn't look right, we'll take steps to limit their playing privileges."

#  Blackjack Team Ends Hollywood Run with a Bang

The world-famous blackjack team who had been running Hollywood for years finally called it quits this week. The team, which consisted of six players and one expert card counter, managed to bring in over $1 million in profits during their time in Hollywood, but decided to move on to other pursuits.

"It's been a great run," said team leader John, "but we all feel like it's time to move on." The team first made headlines in 2010, when they took down the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas. They then moved on to Los Angeles, where they continued their winning streak.

One member of the team, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the decision to break up the team was not an easy one. "We've all become great friends over the years," he said, "and it's going to be tough not playing together anymore." But he added that they all felt it was time to move on.

John refused to disclose what the members of the team would be doing next, but he did say that they were all excited about their new projects. "We're all looking forward to starting fresh and seeing what we can accomplish."
