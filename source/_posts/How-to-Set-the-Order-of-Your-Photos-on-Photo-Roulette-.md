#  How to Control Which Photos Come Up First on Photo Roulette 
Photo roulette, a game in which you flip through a set of photos and select one to share with others, can be great fun. But if you don’t want certain embarrassing or otherwise undesirable photos to come up first, there are a couple things you can do.

The first thing to do is make sure your most embarrassing photos are buried in the back of your photo album. The further back they are, the less likely it is that they will come up first on photo roulette.

If your embarrassing photos are all up front, you can try editing the album’s index so that the order of the photos is different. This way, the embarrassing photos will not come up as quickly when someone flips through the album.

Editing an album’s index used to be tricky, but there are now apps that make it easy. Just search for “photo index editor” in the App Store or Google Play store and you should find one that will work for you.

#  How to Set Your Preferred Photos to Appear on Photo Roulette 

In this article, we are going to show you how to set your preferred photos to appear on Photo Roulette. 

First and foremost, open up the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad. Then, select the album you would like to use for Photo Roulette. 

After that, tap on the Share button in the bottom-left corner of the screen, then choose the Photo Roulette option. 

A new window will pop up, letting you know that the selected album will be used as your source for random photos. Just underneath that message, you will see a list of all of your Facebook friends who also use Photo Roulette. 

To set a preferred photo for one of your Facebook friends, tap on their name and then select one of your photos from the following options: Photos, Videos, or Albums. After you’ve made your selection, just hit the blue Choose button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. 

If you want to remove someone from the list of friends who can send you random photos, just swipe left on their name and then hit the Delete button that appears. 

You can also choose to limit who can send you random photos by selecting either All Friends or Specific Friends from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. 

That’s all there is to it! Now when someone sends you a random photo using Photo Roulette, it will be one of your preferred pics instead of a totally random shot.

#  How to Choose the Best Photos for Photo Roulette 

When playing photo roulette, the best photos are those that are interesting and engaging. Whether you’re using a physical deck of cards or an online casino game, it’s important to choose the right photos to keep the game exciting.

When selecting photos for your game, be sure to consider the following:

- The subject matter of each photo
- The colors in each photo
- The overall mood of each photo

Subject Matter
The subject matter of each photo is important for two reasons. First, it determines whether or not a particular photo is appropriate for the game. Second, it helps to create a sense of continuity and rhythm as players flip through the photos.

If you’re creating a physical deck of cards, try to select a variety of different types of photos. This could include landscape photos, portrait photos, action shots, and so on. If you’re playing an online casino game, try to find a variety of different types of photos that will keep players engaged.

Color Palette
The colors in each photo also play an important role in the overall feel of the game. Monochromatic palettes can be calming and relaxing, while bright and colorful palettes can add excitement and energy. Be sure to select colors that complement each other and create a harmonious look.

Mood/ atmosphere 
Finally, it’s important to consider the mood or atmosphere created by each photo. Is it dark and suspenseful? Is it lighthearted and cheerful? Each photo should evoke a specific feeling in order to set the tone for the game.
